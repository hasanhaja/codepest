# CodePest
This is a rough port of some of the challenges from UoB-CodeFest in Python. The main purpose of this was for my brother to practise programming, but feel free to try these simple challenges out.

# Usage
Clone the repo and implement your solutions in `solutions.py`. To run the program, run it using: `python main.py`

For example, if the challenge was stated as such:
```python
test(solution(13) == 169)
```
Then `solution` should be implemented as such:

```python
def solution(number):
    return number*number
```

The purpose of these exercises to solve these problems fairly quickly, and it is acceptable if the solutions are not the most elegant. As long as you are not hardcoding the results, it does not matter if the solution are not very generic.

Most of all, it is supposed to be a bit of fun! Try getting creative in how you approach these problems.

# Maintenance
I might be adding more challenges based on UoB-CodeFest later, and I might even design some of my own. Since these challenges are meant to be little programming katas, I may not be adding more challenges frequently.
